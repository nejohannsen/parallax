My partner in E2, Elizabeth says, "Chrystyne gives good face." I would make it plural, faces. Chrystyne comes at you in ways neither you nor your camera lens can ignore. She is bold; she is beautiful. Since she was first referred to me in December 2002 by my good friend and highly admired fellow photographer, Jim Hewitt, she has been a staple of my imagery. Such imagery has run the gamut from urban glamour to erotic fetish scenes. Whatever the venue, Chrystyne brings a high degree of professionalism and charisma to the project. I was pleased to call her model. I am even more pleased to call her friend. The chemistry, which the three of us share, is undeniable.
