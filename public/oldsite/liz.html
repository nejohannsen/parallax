When I think of Elizabeth, I recall the words of the Rolling Stones' She's a Rainbow. One verse goes,  "She comes in colors everywhere, She's like a rainbow." Elizabeth, whom I met on January 16, 2002, is one of the most poised and versatile models, I know. I have had the privilege of working with her on many varied shoots and she never ceases to amaze me. She continues to surprise me time after time, virtually altering her appearance to suit the shoot and the venue. Elizabeth has also aided me in producing a wide range of images transitioning from glamour nudes to some of the most exciting fetish images, which I have produced to date. I truly treasure each and every opportunity, which I have to work with her. I have presented a wide range of images, which I have taken of her. She is professional, poised and beyond all, a great sport and a collaborative spirit.
