      <P>The WIB (Women in Black) is a career long project to capture black and 
        white images of Chicago women. The goal is to illustrate, through Ed's 
        photographs, the range of diversity Chicago women offer to the world. 
        Sabrina, Mandy, Bridgette and Antje are just a few of the many women who 
        will be featured in this work. The WIB Project is currently seeking inspirational 
        Chicago women to be featured in this work. Simply call Ed at 312.245-9514 
        or email him at <A HREF="mailto:photographer@emering.com">photographer@emering.com</A>. 
        Take your place in this work, or recommend a friend. </P>
