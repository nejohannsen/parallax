<p>It’s hard to even begin to describe Trina. Alternative will do for starters. Goth may do as well. She has burst onto the scene as one of Chicagoland’s hottest alternative models with her images being snapped up by Bizarre on her first try. She’s a total natural and the camera loves her from nearly every angle imaginable. On top of which, working with her is fantastic. An accomplished artist in her own right and trained dancer, she brings a tremendous collaborative influence to her work. <b>Parallax</b> and its sister firm <b>Triple E Studios</b> is pleased to have the <b>Jaded Kitte </b>as one of its regular models.</p><p>

Trian plays well with others. She appears in photos with Alexandria, the Queen of Pentacles and Ravenfire in these galleries.</p> <br><br>
