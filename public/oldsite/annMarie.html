I first met the ingénue, Ann Marie, on October 24, 2001. She was a fledgling photographer's model, who contacted me looking to build a portfolio of work from Chicago's leading art photographers. I had no idea what to expect during our first encounter. Much to my surprise Ann Marie was a vivacious, creative and hardworking model. The chemistry between us was strong immediate. We have been working very closely with each other ever since. I have seen Ann Marie's modeling talent build and grow in leaps and bounds. Her willingness to pose in a variety of venues and guises has allowed me to produce some of my best professional photographic work ever. This gallery is a tribute to the range and diversity of our work together. From time to time new creative images will be added as the body of our work continues to grow.<br><br>For more information about Ann Marie visit
