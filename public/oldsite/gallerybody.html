<P>My photographic career began by looking into the gaping mouth, full of razor
sharp teeth, of a Great White Shark. From the moment that I took my first
professional photograph of this huge beast, I knew that &quot;stealing beauty&quot; by
capturing the images on film would become my passion. My first professional
film assignment was working underwater with the crew filming the Jaws sequels.
As a master SCUBA instructor, they needed someone willing to swim with Great
Whites. Needless to say, my earlier experiences qualified me for the job.</P>

<P>From the commercially successful shark photography, I moved into the world of
photojournalism freelancing for such magazines as Underwater Geographic and
SCUBA Times. I supplemented this work with a wide variety of commercial
assignments.</P>

<P>While I continue to have a passion for underwater photography, I have learned
to apply my skills to macro photography above water. Much of this work is
featured in my books.</P>

<P>The images featured in this Gallery are among my favorites. They represent the
various venues in which I have worked. They each have a special memory, some
bitter, some sweet. Many were featured in my 1998 one-man show, &quot;Through
Souless Eyes.&quot;</P>

<P>Currently, I am working on a number of new books, including the Women in Black
(WIB) project as well as multiple fashion catalog assignments.</P>
