"Where's that accent from," I asked stupidly at our first meeting. I expected that this tall, willowy actor/model would offer up some exotic Eastern European location. "Ohio," came the reply. Thus started a highly professional, productive and creative working relationship, which has continued to this very day.
<br><br>
Natanya, who plies her trade as a fulltime artists' model at one of Chicago's leading art schools, brings a highly professional and collaborative work ethic to her photographic modeling assignments. She has unparalleled self-composure, which shows through in the exceptional quality of her work. The images presented here are from the various assignments, which we have cooperated on over the past two years. In the future, additional images from our work will be added. <br><br>
